## Description
A regex, which is short for `regular expression`, is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. They are also frequently used to validate input. This regex is designed to identify and validate URLs, including optional HTTP/HTTPS, domain names, paths, and more.
